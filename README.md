## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Note

In this code I only worked on responsivity on the 2 breakpoints that were specified (1440px for Desktop and 375px for Mobile). More optimization for responsivity can be made at more breakpoints.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this section I learned more about div widths as well as image widths and coding in a mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

I would definitely be looking forward to going deeper into css and working on responsivity in an even better way.
